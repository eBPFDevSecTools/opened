The last argument , <[ flags ]>(IP: 2) , holds the number of stack frames to skip (from 0 to 255) , masked with BPF_F_SKIP_FIELD_MASK.

BPF_F_REUSE_STACKID If two different stacks hash into the same stackid , discard the old one. The stack id retrieved is a 32 bit long integer handle which can be further combined with other data (including other stack ids) and used as a key into maps. This can be useful for generating a variety of graphs (such as flame graphs or off-cpu graphs).

"Return Type": "int", "Description": "Read the value of a perf event counter , and store it into <[ buf ]>(IP: 2) of size buf_size. This helper relies on a <[ map ]>(IP: 0) of type BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY. The nature of the perf event counter is selected when <[ map ]>(IP: 0) is updated with perf event file descriptors. The <[ map ]>(IP: 0) is an array whose size is the number of available CPUs , and each cell contains a value relative to one CPU. The value to retrieve is indicated by <[ flags ]>(IP: 1) , that contains the index of the CPU to look up , masked with BPF_F_INDEX_MASK. Alternatively , <[ flags ]>(IP: 1) can be set to BPF_F_CURRENT_CPU to indicate that the value for the current CPU should be retrieved. This helper behaves in a way close to perf_event_read() helper , save that instead of just returning the value observed , it fills the <[ buf ]>(IP: 2) structure. This allows for additional data to be retrieved: in particular , the enabled and running times (in buf->enabled and buf->running , respectively) are copied. In general , perf_event_read_value() is recommended over perf_event_read() , which has some ABI issues and provides fewer functionalities. These values are interesting , because hardware PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit) counters are limited resources. When there are more PMU based perf events opened than available counters , kernel will multiplex these events so each event gets certain percentage (but not all) of the PMU time. In case that multiplexing happens , the number of samples or counter value will not reflect the case compared to when no multiplexing occurs. This makes comparison between different runs difficult. Typically , the counter value should be normalized before comparing to other experiments. The usual normalization is done as follows. normalized_counter = counter * t_enabled / t_running Where t_enabled is the time enabled for event and t_running is the time running for event since last normalization. The enabled and running times are accumulated since the perf event open. To achieve scaling factor between two invocations of an eBPF program , users can can use CPU id as the key (which is typical for perf array usage model) to remember the previous value and do the calculation inside the eBPF program.
